This project aims to predict the yield category of crops (Low, Medium, High) using machine learning models trained on agricultural data.
It leverages key features like soil type, rainfall, temperature, and fertilizer usage to classify the expected crop yield, helping in better planning and decision-making for farmers and agricultural agencies.
